# Profound Example

This is an example of a responsive, fluid grid with a max-width. It is using the [Profound Grid](http://www.profoundgrid.com/), and is built using the styleguide [here](http://css-tricks.com/sass-style-guide/) for Sass best practices.

## Setup

To run this locally:

* Git clone this repo to your local machine
* `cd` into the repo's directory
* Run `npm install` in the directory, this will install dependencies
* Run `grunt` which will compile the CSS and watch for changes
* Fire up MAMP/WAMP/etc. and browse to this directory in a browser
